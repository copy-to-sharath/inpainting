# Synthetic COCO Training with Diffusion & Transformers

This project demonstrates generating synthetic data using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, then training a transformerâ€‘based model on the COCO dataset using PyTorch Lightning. Hyperparameter tuning, logging with MLflow & TensorBoard, and model export in both PyTorch MAR and Hugging Face formats are included.
